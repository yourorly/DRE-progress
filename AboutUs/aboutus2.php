        <h2>The Black Apartment</h2>
        <p>DRE encountered challenges before becoming a successful small-business owner.
            DRE once ran a food business called "Black Apartment", but it did not go well due to Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in substantial financial losses. After years of losing business, one of the DRE owner's friend sponsors their business, and they are given the opportunity to start one, which is why DRE began through friendship.
            The owner enjoys food, particularly chicken. That's why DRE is well-known for its best-selling flavored chicken. DRE originates from the term PRE, which is an informal term to refer to a call for a friend. Its business is based on the sale of goods and services, which involves a buyer and a seller, a regular process, profit motives, and satisfying what the customer wants.
